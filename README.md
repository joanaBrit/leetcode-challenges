# LeetCode Challenges ðŸš€

Welcome to my LeetCode practice repository! Here, you'll find my solutions to multiple LeetCode coding problems, written in `JavaScript` and `Python`.

### Why Am I Doing This?

I'm solving LeetCode problems to:

* ðŸ§  Strengthen my problem-solving skills 
* ðŸ’¼ Prepare for technical interviews 
* ðŸŒ± Expand my knowledge and become a better developer 
  
I plan to code every day of the week, solving at least one problem (sometimes more!). To keep things interesting, I'll alternate between `JavaScript` and `Python`.
